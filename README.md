Peer Review: On the surface, everthing is in place with the exception of some items being a bit off from the example. The input boxes and buttons work. Another thing I had noticed was that the font was not the same to the example, but it is similar. And the there no responsiveness. Otherwise, for a challenging project like this, it was a very good attempt.
